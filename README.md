# CustomerSegKMeans
This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The algorithm helps in identifying patterns and segments within the customer base, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Overview

This repository contains code for implementing the K-means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation based on their purchase history. The project aims to help businesses analyze customer behavior and create targeted marketing strategies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/astromanu007/PRODIGY_ML_02.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PRODIGY_ML_02
   ```

3. Install the required libraries (assuming you have Python and pip installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure your dataset contains relevant columns like 'Amount', 'Frequency', etc., in CSV format.
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the clustering algorithm:
   - Open and run the `customer_segmentation.py` script.
   - Follow the prompts to choose the optimal number of clusters (K) using the elbow method.
   - The script will generate visualizations and cluster results.

3. Interpret the results:
   - Analyze the cluster characteristics, centroids, and average purchase amounts by cluster.
   - Use the insights for targeted marketing strategies or personalized customer experiences.

## File Structure
